# Basic line graph

# All this graphing should automatically be done in a separate window
# according to the settings I have picked

# Begin on graph 1
# Take flux values and graph voltage values
# Increment graphs as bias increases
# Some sort of while statement that plots the data for a specific bias value
# Read data from Kalamari Code for the specific bias value
# Increment the axs[] as the bias increases

# Create 4 graphs
# Constrained layout
# Automatically adjusts things so they cleanly fit in the figure window
# Needs to be activated before any axes are added
# It looks like you actually plot the graph using a for loop and increment through
# axs[i]

# Superimpose all the graphs on each other

# Boom, done, jupyter script replica
